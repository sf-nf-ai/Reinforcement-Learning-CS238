In this project, we chose to train a Q-learning agent to play the Atari Breakout game
without using Deep Q Network (DQN). The input comes as video frames representing the 
game screen at an instant t. We implemented a technique to encode the frames into a much 
lower dimensional array, so that the agent could be trained on a resource-constrained system.
